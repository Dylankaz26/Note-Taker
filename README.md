# Note-Taker

## Description
This web application is designed to help a user not only write down notes for themselves but also save and store them for later. You can add titles to each note so that it is easier to filter through and find.

## Usage
Click the get started button in the middle on the homepage. This will direct you to the notes page. After that on the left you will see any saved notes along with a trash icon to delete any notes you do not want anymore. On the right there is a plus sign to create a new note where you can add a title and any text below it. Once you add text and a title to your new notes there is a save button in the top right corner where you can store this note for later
